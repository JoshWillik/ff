# ff

Find and open a file quickly by file pattern

## Installation

```
go install github.com/joshwillik/ff
```

## Usage

```
ff <pattern>
```

## Plans

- support Sublime Text style fuzzy matching
- if more than one match, allow chosing which file to open
- always do search from git root if inside a git project
